# Select port for image capture
100 : Use Camera Still Port to capture images. This port is slower but 
produces better quality pictures. $
101 : Use Video Port to capture images. Allows rapid image captures up to the 
rate of video frames. The tradeoff is that the image quality is not as good.\n\n
Note: Exif metadata will not be included in JPEG output. This is due to an
underlying firmware limitation. $
102 : Turn On/Off the LED via GPIO.\n\n
If a GPIO library is available (only RPi.GPIO is currently supported),
and if the python process has the necessary privileges (typically this
means running as root via sudo), this control can be used to set the
state of the camera's LED.\n\nAt present, the camera's LED cannot be controlled
on the Pi 3 (the GPIOs used to control the camera LED were re-routed to GPIO
expander on the Pi 3). (C) $

# Picture / Video Capture
120 : Enable selection of the image/video image size from the drop down list.\n\n
This attribute, in combination with framerate, determines the mode that the 
camera operates in. The actual sensor framerate and resolution used by the camera 
is influenced, but not directly set, by the selection. (C) $
121 : List of standard image/video sizes. $
122 : Enable selection of a non-standard image/video size using the two drop down lists. $
123 : List of new widths for the image/video.\n\nThe size is set in 32 byte boundaries. $

# Resize after
140 : Do not resize image after capture. $
141 : Resize the image after capture. Use drop down lists to select the new width/height.\n\n
Exif metadata will not be included in JPEG output. This is due to an underlying firmware
limitation. $
142 : List of new widths for the resized image.\n\nThe size is set in 32 byte boundaries. $
143 : List of new heights for the resized image.\n\nThe size is set in 16 byte boundaries. $

181 : Flash mode is automatically set based on exposure parameters. $
182 : Select Flash mode from the drop down list. $
183 : List of manuualy selectable Flash modes.\n\n
Note: You must define which GPIO pins the camera is to use for flash and privacy 
indicators. This is done within the Device Tree configuration which is considered 
an advanced topic. Specifically, you need to define pins FLASH_0_ENABLE and 
optionally FLASH_0_INDICATOR (for the privacy indicator). More information 
can be found in\n\n
https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/recipes2.html#flash-configuration $

# ------------- Exposure Tab ----------------
# Metering Mode
200 : List of available metering modes. All modes set up two regions, a
center region, and an outer region. The major difference between each mode is
the size of the center region.\n\nThe 'backlit' mode has the largest central region
(30% of the width), while 'spot' has the smallest (10% of the width).\n\n
The default value is 'average'. (C) $

# Exposure Mode
205 : Fully automated exposure mode. \n\nNOTE: Users should wait for the Analog and 
Digital gain values to settle before taking a picture or video. $
206 : Preset Exposure. Select from the drop down list.\n\nNOTE: Users should wait for
the Analog and Digital gain values to settle before taking a picture or video. $
207 : Manually set ISO. Select from the drop down list.\n\nNOTE: Users should wait 
for the Analog and Digital gain values to settle before taking a picture or video. $
208 : Exposure OFF - fixed analog and digital gains.\n\nNOTE: Setting to OFF after gains have 
settled is a good way to ensure multiple pictures have the same exposure. $
209 : List of preset exposure types. $
210 : List of preset ISO values.\n\nOn the V1 camera module, non-zero ISO values attempt
to fix overall gain at various levels. For example, ISO 100 attempts to provide an 
overall gain of 1.0, ISO 200 attempts to provide overall gain of 2.0, etc. 
The algorithm prefers analog gain over digital gain to reduce noise.\n\n
On the V2 camera module, ISO 100 attempts to produce overall gain of ~1.84, 
and ISO 800 attempts to produce overall gain of ~14.72 (the V2 camera module was 
calibrated against the ISO film speed standard).$
211 : Current analog gain.\n\nNOTE: Users should wait for this value to settle before taking 
a picture or video. $
212 : Current digital gain.\n\nNOTE: Users should wait for this value to settle before taking 
a picture or video. $
213 : Actual ISO. This value is caculated by (Analog_Gain / Digital_Gain) * 100.0 $
214 : Apparent ISO. If Exposure Mode is Auto or one of the Preset Exposures, then this 
value is Auto, else it is the Manually set value. $

# Exposure compensation - DRC
# Add radio buttons Disable / Enable
230 : Adjust the camera's exposure compensation level.\n\n
The default value is 0. Larger values result in brighter images, smaller (negative) values 
result in dimmer images. $
231 : Disable exposure compensation (default). $
232 : Enable exposure compensation. Adjust the amount using the slider. $
233 : Disable Dynamic Range Compression (off). $
234 : Select the strength of the dynamic range compression applied to the camera's output 
using the drop down list.\n\nWARNING: Enabling DRC will override fixed white balance gains
(set under Auto white balance settings). $
235 : List of available DRC strengths to apply to the camera's output. $

# Auto White Balance Settings
250 : Fully automated Auto White Balance (AWB).\n\nNOTE: Users should wait for the Red and 
Blue gains to settle before taking a picture or video. $
251 : Enable selection of preset scenes for AWB from the drop down list.\n\nNOTE: Users 
should wait for the Red and Blue gains to settle before taking a picture or video. $
252 : AWB is OFF. The user may manually set the values for Red Gain and Blue Gain.\n\n
NOTE: Setting AWB to OFF after the gains have settled is a good way to ensure multiple 
pictures have the same exposure. $
253 : List of available preset AWB scenes.\n\nNOTE: Users 
should wait for the Red and Blue gains to settle before taking a picture or video.  $
254 : The current value of the Red Gain.\n\nWhen AWB is OFF, then the user may adjust
the value of the Red Gain.\n\nEach gain must be between 0.0 and 8.0. 
Typical values are between 0.9 and 1.9. $
255 : The current value of the Blue Gain.\n\nWhen AWB is OFF, then the user may adjust
the value of the Blue Gain.\n\nEach gain must be between 0.0 and 8.0. 
Typical values are between 0.9 and 1.9. $

# Shutter Speed
300 : Shutter speed will be automatically determined by the auto-exposure algorithm. 
Faster shutter times naturally require greater amounts of illumination and vice versa. $
301 : The current exposure speed speed of the camera. If you have set shutter speed to a 
non-zero value, then exposure speed and shutter speed should be equal. If shutter speed
is Auto, then this value is the actual exposure speed currently in use.$
302 : Manually set the shutter speed using the edit field and drop down selection. 
In later firmwares, this attribute is limited by the value of the framerate attribute.\n\n 
For example, if the Frame rate is set to 30.0 fps, the shutter speed cannot be slower than 
33,333µs (1 / Frame rate).\n\n When shutter speed is used, the exposure speed value
matches the shutter speed value. $
303 : Enter the shutter speed value.\n\nNote: The programmed value is limited to either:\n\n
a.) 1 / (fixed framerate + framerate delta), if fixed framerate.\n
b.) 1 / (framerate range 'From' value), if framerate range. $
304 : Select the shutter speed multiplier.\n\nNote: The programmed value is limited to 
either:\n\n
a.) 1 / (fixed framerate + framerate delta), if fixed framerate.\n
b.) 1 / (framerate range 'From' value), if framerate range. $

# Framerate
310 : The currently programmed frame rate.\n\n
If an error is detected in the selected framerate values, the color of the messages will be Red
else Blue for no errors detected. $
311 : Enable a fixed framerate. $
312 : Enter the fixed framerate.\n\n
The edit field allows the use of the '/' character to specify a fraction, e.g. 
entering 1/6 is interpreted as 0.16666667, or 15/2.5 is 6.0.\n\n
The lowest framerate value is fixed at 1/6 (or a 6 second maximum shutter speed), 
the highest framerate value is fixed at 90. $
313 : Enable a framerate range. $
314 : Enter the framerate range 'From' value.\n\n
The edit field allows the use of the '/' character to specify a fraction, e.g. 
entering 1/6 is interpreted as 0.16666667, or 15/2.5 is 6.0.\n\n
The lowest framerate range 'From' value is fixed at 1/6 (or a 6 second maximum shutter speed), 
the highest framerate range 'From' value must be less than the framerate range 'To' value. $
315 : Enter a framerate delta that is applied to the fixed framerate. \n\n
The edit field allows the use of the '/' character to specify a fraction, e.g. 
entering 1/6 is interpreted as 0.16666667, or 15/2.5 is 6.0.\n\n
The lowest framerate delta is fixed at -10, the highest
framerate delta is fixed at 10.$
316 : Enter the framerate range 'To' value.\n\n
The edit field allows the use of the '/' character to specify a fraction, e.g. 
entering 1/6 is interpreted as 0.16666667, or 15/2.5 is 6.0.\n\n
The lowest framerate range 'To' value must be greater than the framerate range 'From'
value, the highest framerate range 'To' value is fixed at 90. $

# ------------- Advanced Tab ----------------
350 : Select Auto sensor mode (default).\n\nThis is an advanced property which can be 
used to control the camera's sensor 
mode. By default, mode 0 is used which allows the camera to automatically select 
an input mode based on the requested resolution and framerate. $
351 : Select a sensor mode from the drop down list.\n\n
Valid values are currently between Mode 1 and Mode 7. The set of valid sensor modes
(along with the heuristic used to select one automatically) are detailed in the 
Sensor Modes section of the documentation. (C) $
352 : List of valid sensor modes from mode 1 to mode 7.\n\n
NOTE: At the time of writing, setting this property does nothing unless the camera 
has been initialized with a sensor mode other than 0. Furthermore, some mode 
transitions appear to require setting the property twice (in a row). 
This appears to be a firmware limitation. $
360: Set the clock mode to 'reset'.\n\n
This is an advanced property which can be used to control the nature of the frame 
timestamps available from the frame property. When this is “reset” (the default) 
each frame's timestamp will be relative to the start of the recording. (C) $
361: Set the clock mode to 'raw'.\n\n
This is an advanced property which can be used to control the nature of the frame 
timestamps available from the frame property. When this is 
“raw”, each frame's timestamp will be relative to the last initialization of the camera.
(C) $
362 : The camera's timestamp is a 64-bit integer representing the number of microseconds 
since the last system boot. When the camera's clock_mode is 'raw' the values returned 
by this attribute are comparable to those from the frame timestamp attribute. (C) $
363 : Statistics will be calculated from the preceding preview frame (this also 
applies when the preview is not visible). $
364 : Statistics will be calculated from the captured image itself.\n\n
The advantages to calculating scene statistics from the captured image are that 
time between startup and capture is reduced as only the AGC (automatic gain control) 
has to converge. The downside is that processing time for captures increases and 
that white balance and gain won't necessarily match the preview.\n\n
Warning: Enabling the still statistics pass will override fixed white balance gains. (C) $
370 : Remove any color effect applied to the camera. $
371 : Set the color effect applied to the camera using the three sliders.\n\n
For example, to make the image black and white set both U and V slider values to 128 
(center of the slider range). $
372 : Adjust the luminance ('Y') applied to the color effect. This has about the same affect as
adjusting the Brightness slider on the Basic Controls tab. $
373 : Adjust the 'U' chromiance value of the color effect. Range is from 0 to 255. $
374 : Adjust the 'V' chromiance value of the color effect. Range is from 0 to 255. $
375 : The current YUV value of the color effect applied to the camera. \n\n
'Y' is the Brightness, 'U' and 'V' are the chromiance values from the sliders. $
376 : The RGB value of the color effect applied to the camera.\n\n
RGB is calculated from YUV as follows:\n
Red = Clamp(Y + 1.370705 * (V-128))\n
Green = Clamp(Y - 0.337633 * (U-128) - 0.698001 * (V-128))\n
Blue = Clamp(Y + 1.732446 * (U-128)) $
377 : Current color effect. The effect is also shown in the preview window. $

#-------------- Photo Params Dialog -----------------
2000 : Defines the quality of the JPEG encoder as an integer ranging from 1 to 100. 
Defaults to 85. \n\n
Note: JPEG quality is not a percentage and definitions of quality vary widely. (C) $
2001 : Current value of JPEG encoder quality. $
2010 : Defines the restart interval for the JPEG encoder as a number of JPEG MCUs. 
The actual restart interval used will be a multiple of the number of MCUs per row 
in the resulting image. (C) $
2015 : No thumbnail is included in the EXIF metadata. $
2020 : Defines the size and quality of the thumbnail to embed in the Exif metadata. 
Specifying None disables thumbnail generation. Otherwise, specify a tuple of 
(width, height, quality). Defaults to (64, 48, 35). (C) $
2021 : Select the width of the embedded thumbnail image.\n\n
For best results, the width to height ratio should closely match the image width to height
ratio. $
2022 : Select the height of the embedded thumbnail image.\n\n
For best results, the width to height ratio should closely match the image width to height
ratio.  $
2023 : Defines the quality of the thumbnail. Defaults to 40.\n\n
See JPEG quality for more information. $
2030 : No Bayer data is included in Exif metadata. $
2031 : Raw bayer data from the camera's sensor is included in the Exif metadata. $
2100 : Enable / disable including EXIF metadata when the quick image is saved.\n\n
Note: EXIF data is always included in picamera JPEG files. This option pertains to
saving the image that is displayed in the photo viewer pane. The PILLOW library is
used to save the image. At this point, the EXIF data can be included or excluded
 from the saved image.\n\n
Any JPEG files that are saved immediately using picamera functions will always have EXIF
data. $
2110 : Enter text that is included in the JPEG EXIF metadata. The data is saved under
the tag 'EXIF.UserComment'. $

#-------------- Video Params Dialog -----------------
3000 : Select the H.264 profile to use for encoding. Defaults to ‘high', but can be 
one of ‘baseline', ‘main', ‘extended', ‘high', or ‘constrained'. $
3001 : The H.264 level to use for encoding. Defaults to ‘4', but can be any H.264 level 
up to ‘4.2'. $
3002 : The key frame rate (the rate at which I-frames are inserted in the output).\n\n
Select None (default).\n
Select Single initial I-frame, and then only P-frames subsequently.\n
Select Frames between I-frames. The number of frames is entered in the edit field.\n\n
Note: split_recording() will fail in this mode. (C) $
3003 : The number of frames between I-Frames. $
3004 : Select the key frame format (the way in which I-frames will be inserted into 
the output stream). Defaults to None, but can be one of ‘cyclic', ‘adaptive', ‘both', 
or ‘cyclicrows'. $
3005 : The encoder should output SPS/PPS headers within the stream to 
ensure GOPs (groups of pictures) are self describing. This is important for streaming 
applications where the client may wish to seek within the stream, and enables the use 
of split_recording(). (C) $
3006 : Do not output SPS/PPS headers within the stream. $
3007 : The encoder should include “Supplemental Enhancement Information” within the 
output stream. $
3008 : Do not include “Supplemental Enhancement Information” data within output 
stream. $
3009 : The encoder includes the camera's framerate in the SPS header. $
3010 : Do not include the camera's framerate in the SPS header. $
3011 : No motion vector estimation data is output. $
3012 : Motion vector estimation data is output to the selected file. $
3013 : Select a file to which to save motion vector estimation data. $
3014 : Currently selected file for saving motion vector estimation data. $

#-------------- Image Effects Dialog ---------------
4000 : Control the quantization steps for the image. Valid values are 2 to 32, 
and the default is 4. $
4001 : Current quantization level. $
4010 : Set the size of the blur kernel. Valid values are 1 or 2. $
4011 : Current blur kernel size. $
4020 : Select the quadrant of the U/V space from which to retain chroma.\n\n 
0=green, 1=red/yellow, 2=blue, 3=purple.\n\nThere is no default; this effect 
does nothing until parameters are set. $
4030 : Select the direction of the colorswap.\n\n
Swap RGB to BGR or swap RGB to BRG. $

# ------------- Annotation Dialog ----------------
400 : Disable text annotation on the preview or image. $
401 : Enable text annotation on the preview or image. Enter the text in the edit field. $
402 : Enable / disable adding a timestamp on the preview and image. The timestamp format
may be modified by selecting File | Preferences... then selecting the Interface tab. $
403 : Text to annotate on the preview and image. $
404 : Adjust text annotation size from 6 to 150. The default is 32. $
405 : No background color is applied to the annotation text output. $
406 : Select of background color for the annotation text output. $
407 : Display a color chooser dialog for the background color. $
408 : Use the default white color for the annotation text output. $
409 : Select of text color for the annotation text output. The underlying 
firmware does not directly support setting all components of the text color,
only the Y' component of a Y'UV tuple. This is roughly (but not precisely) 
analogous to the “brightness” of a color, so you may choose to think of 
this as setting how bright the annotation text will be relative to its
background. (C) $
410 : Adjust the relative 'brightness' of the annotation text color from 
black to white.\n\nThe Y component of the YUV color tuple is varied from
0.0 to 1.0 while keeping the U and V components 0. $
