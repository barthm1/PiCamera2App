	What controls are needed for this page?
	Photo captures:
		Type of Time lapse
			Burst
			Timed
			etc
		Whether the image settings stay the same for each picture - Checkbox
		Whether the Video port is used or not (faster) - Checkbox
		Filename		(Textbox entry)
		Start
			Immediately
			Delay XXX YYY SEC, MIN HR
			On a specific date/time
		Delay between each shot.... or at a specific time each day, etc....
			e.g., Every XX YYY where XX is a number YYY is SEC, MIN, HR, DAY
			e.g., On every MIN, 1/2 HR, HOUR
			e.g., Every Day at XX:XX Time
		When does the capture end
			After XXX shots		XXX from 1 to 1000?
			After XXX minutes, Hours, Days
			On XXXX date
		Append a number or a date/time to 'Filename' - or both
			Use Drop down ComboBox
			e.g.	Bill_1.jpg, Bill_2.jpg, ... etc
			or		Bill_Date_Time.jpg, Bill_Date_Time.jpg, ... etc
			or both Bill_Date_Time_1.jpg, Bill_Date_Time_2.jpg, ... etc
	What about video captures?

The following script provides a brief example of configuring these settings:

from time import sleep
from picamera import PiCamera

camera = PiCamera(resolution=(1280, 720), framerate=30)
# Set ISO to the desired value
camera.iso = 100
# Wait for the automatic gain control to settle
sleep(2)
# Now fix the values
camera.shutter_speed = camera.exposure_speed
camera.exposure_mode = 'off'
g = camera.awb_gains
camera.awb_mode = 'off'
camera.awb_gains = g
# Finally, take several photos with the fixed settings
camera.capture_sequence(['image%02d.jpg' % i for i in range(10)])

from time import sleep
from picamera import PiCamera

camera = PiCamera()
camera.start_preview()
sleep(2)
for filename in camera.capture_continuous('img{counter:03d}.jpg'):
    print('Captured %s' % filename)
    sleep(300) # wait 5 minutes

def wait():
    # Calculate the delay to the start of the next hour
    next_hour = (datetime.now() + timedelta(hour=1)).replace(

3.7. Capturing in low light
Using similar tricks to those in Capturing consistent images, the Pi’s
camera can capture images in low light conditions. The primary objective
is to set a high gain, and a long exposure time to allow the camera to
gather as much light as possible. However, the shutter_speed attribute
is constrained by the camera’s framerate so the first thing we need to
do is set a very slow framerate. The following script captures an image
with a 6 second exposure time (the maximum the Pi’s V1 camera module is
capable of; the V2 camera module can manage 10 second exposures):

from picamera import PiCamera
from time import sleep
from fractions import Fraction

# Force sensor mode 3 (the long exposure mode), set
# the framerate to 1/6fps, the shutter speed to 6s,
# and ISO to 800 (for maximum gain)
camera = PiCamera(
    resolution=(1280, 720),
    framerate=Fraction(1, 6),
    sensor_mode=3)
camera.shutter_speed = 6000000
camera.iso = 800
# Give the camera a good long time to set gains and
# measure AWB (you may wish to use fixed AWB instead)
sleep(30)
camera.exposure_mode = 'off'
# Finally, capture an image with a 6s exposure. Due
# to mode switching on the still port, this will take
# longer than 6 seconds
camera.capture('dark.jpg')
